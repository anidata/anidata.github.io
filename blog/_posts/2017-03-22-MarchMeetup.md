During our [March Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Anidata/events/238218373/){:.show-link .accent}, Jenny Blase delivered her fun findings on the robust dating data and research done around the world. She presented the correlations between our perceived desires against actual results. If you weren't able to join us, the results often contradict our best judgment. We also had the pleasure of listening to Jonathan Cox's project pitch of the data portal that he built for the AJC. He previously worked with the news company and pitched for participation in building the public-facing section of the app.
