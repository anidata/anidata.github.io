        <p>The mission of Anidata is to provide mentorship for data science professionals through projects that benefit the surrounding community. We apply active, practical, and data-related technical expertise to produce software products that affect positive change, giving preference to endeavors that improve the lives of those in the margins of society.</p>

<a name="about"></a>
<h3 class="main">About Us</h3>
<p>Anidata's story began when Vincent Emanuele asked his fellow co-founder Bob Baxley to help mentor a group of aspiring data scientists in Atlanta.  Vincent had been passionately mentoring students as part of Georgia Tech's Mentor Jackets program, and because of his hard work, he soon discovered that he had more demand from mentees than he could meet.  Around the same time, Vincent had a fortuitous conversation with a local assistant district attorney where it became clear that they were lacking the data science tools to successfully fight human trafficking.  In need of help with the project, Vincent and Bob reached out to Dan Robertson, an aspiring data scientist.  This collaboration with Dan was so successful that it sparked the idea of Anidata: an organization where data scientists of all types could work together on projects that matter.  The two principles that came out of this time became the foundation upon which Anidata is built.
<ol>
  <li> We each have a duty to make sure that the people who come behind us become better professionals faster than we were able to.</li>
  <li> When you enter a community, do something to leave it better than you found it.</li>
</ol>
When these two principles are met, society and humanity progress.  By partnering junior and senior data scientists on a meaningful community project, Anidata strives to live up to these principles.

<h3 class="main">What is 'Anidata'?</h3>
<p>Vincent chose 'Anidata' from a <a class="show-link accent" href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/namesGenUnique.txt" target="_blank">list of human-sounding names</a> generated by a recurrent neural network in a <a class="show-link accent" href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/namesGenUnique.txt" target="_blank">project</a> by Stanford researcher Andrej Karpathy.  The idea that a computer can produce a novel name that feels human reflects Anidata's focus on using the most advanced data science while never forgetting the human element.</p>
